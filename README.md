libintl lite
============

libintl-lite is a simple (but less powerful) GNU gettext libintl replacement originally written by felixhaedicke and released on SourceForge.net: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libintl-lite/

The library does not depends upon any library except the standard C++ library and the STL, thus making it well suited for platforms like Android.
